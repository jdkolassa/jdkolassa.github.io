        <h2 class="heading">I'M JEREMY KOLASSA</h2>
        <p class="text-center">Web developer, content curator, and project manager. At the intersection of computer and human languages is where I make my lair. I love translating technical concepts and jargon into plain English (or any other!) for clients and end-users. I've managed company-wide intiatives to overhaul workflows, written documentation to help users understand how interfaces work, and created eye-catching and pleasing front-end designs -- hooked up to efficient data-delivering backends. My goal is to reduce the number of migraines users, fellow developers, and stakeholders have.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Because after the last few years, we could all use fewer headaches.</p>
